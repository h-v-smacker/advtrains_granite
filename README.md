# Granite locomotive for advanced trains mod

This is a generic train based on contemporary Russian locomotives (initially I wanted to model Granite specifically, but oh well). Which are mostly bricks in shape, with fancy front end.

The maximum speed is 16. It can be used to haul freight or passenger wagons all the same. Holds two people.

The crafting recipe is:

```
{'default:steelblock', 'default:steelblock', 'default:steelblock'},
{'default:glass', 'dye:red', 'dye:white'},
{'advtrains:wheel', 'default:steelblock', 'advtrains:wheel'},
```
